# User Story
As a user, I want a clearer visual separation between UI components, so that the interface is easier to understand and navigate.

# Technical Requirements
- In `src/components/ui/header.tsx`, modify the `<header>` element to enhance its structure:
  - Add a background color by applying the `bg-card` class.
  - Add a bottom border by applying the `border-b` class.
  - Update padding and rounding by replacing `pb-4` with `p-3 rounded-lg`.
- In `src/components/ui/chat-input.tsx`, modify the `<form>` element:
  - Add a box shadow by applying the `shadow-lg` class.
  - Add rounded corners by applying the `rounded-lg` class.

# Acceptance Criteria
- GIVEN the UI is rendered, WHEN the header is inspected, THEN it has the `bg-card`, `border-b`, `p-3`, and `rounded-lg` Tailwind classes applied.
- GIVEN the UI is rendered, WHEN the chat input form is inspected, THEN it has the `shadow-lg` and `rounded-lg` Tailwind classes applied, making it appear elevated.

# Story Points

- **Justification:** The task requires modifying two different components. The changes are simple class additions but touch multiple files and aspects of the UI structure.
