# User Story
As a user, I want key text elements to be more prominent, so that I can quickly identify important information.

# Technical Requirements
- In `src/components/ui/header.tsx`, update the `<h1>` element containing the user's name.
- Apply the `font-bold` Tailwind CSS class by replacing `font-semibold` to make the text bold.

# Acceptance Criteria
- GIVEN the header is rendered, WHEN the user's name is viewed, THEN it is displayed with a bold font weight.

# Story Points
1
- **Justification:** This is a minor, single-line change within one component, involving the replacement of one CSS class.
