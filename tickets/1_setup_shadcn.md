**Task:** Initialize shadcn/ui in the project

**Description:**
As a developer, I need to run the necessary commands to install and configure shadcn/ui in the project repository. This will establish the foundation for our component-based UI development.

**Commands to be Executed by a Human:**
A developer must run the following command and follow the interactive prompts. The recommended answers are provided below.

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest init
```

**Recommended Configuration:**
- **Which style would you like to use?** `Default`
- **Which color would you like to use as base color?** `Slate`
- **Where is your global CSS file?** `src/app/globals.css`
- **Do you want to use CSS variables for colors?** `Yes`
- **Where is your tailwind.config.js file?** `tailwind.config.ts` (or `.js` if that's what you have)
- **Configure import alias for components?** `@/components`
- **Configure import alias for utils?** `@/lib/utils`
- **Are you using React Server Components?** `Yes`
- **Write configuration to `components.json`?** `Yes`

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The `npx shadcn-ui@latest init` command completes successfully.
- A `components.json` file is created in the project root.
- `tailwind.config.ts` and `src/app/globals.css` are updated by the script.
- Required dependencies (e.g., `tailwindcss-animate`, `class-variance-authority`) are added to `package.json`.

**Story Points:** 1
*   **Justification:** This is a foundational setup task that involves running a single command and answering prompts. It has low complexity but is a critical first step.
